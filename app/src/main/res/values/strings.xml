    <string name="description1">
        Covering around 13 hectares, Dresden Zoo is home to more than 2,000 animals and over 300 species.
        The animal residents offer a fascinating journey through all the continents.  Discover vicunas,
        nandus and capybara in the South America section, or Asian hoofed animals such as the rare mishmi
        takin and hog deer, as well as Asian small-clawed otters and orang-utans. And donâ€™t forget to
        stop by at the Tundra aviary or see the Australian red kangaroo!

        The bombing of Dresden on February 13, 1945 also led the zoo to heavy destructions and destroyed almost the entire herd, but already
        in May 1946 took place the reopening. 1950 Wolfgang Ullrich applied for a support center, was once used as a Director and headed
        the zoo until his death in 1973. Since 1968, there is a zoo school.
